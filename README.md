Universal Current measurement device for Low power devices

Major setup in analog electronic is made by @Macola and @Dragan100 on forum:
https://forum.yu3ma.net/thread-2158-post-94918.html#pid94918

Main purpose of this analog electronics is how to measure small current signal down to uA (microAmp) and 
auto range after 5mA to biger range which support up to 2A, without interuption of current flow. This analog part 
is connected on MCU Unit. 
MCU Unit is designed for acumulating measures of current for long period of dynamic current consumption of
low-power devices like GSM enabled devices, LoRa and NB-IoT devices.
